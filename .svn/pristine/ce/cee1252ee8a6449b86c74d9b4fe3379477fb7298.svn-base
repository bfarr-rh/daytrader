There are multiple web application (WAR) assemblies to choose from:

daytrader-web-jdbc - Only requires a web container (like Tomcat v6) and is
	configured to use the JDBC Direct mode of Daytrader (no JMS queued
	orders and no dependency on a transaction manager.)
        Note:  The following prerequisites must be supplied:
	1)  To use the default Derby Embedded DB, you need to copy
	    derby.jar (10.2.2.0 or 10.4.2.0) to the lib directory.

daytrader-web-jpa - Only requires a web container (like Tomcat v6) and is
	configured to use the JPA Direct mode of Daytrader (no JMS queued
	orders and no dependency on a transaction manager.)
        Note:  The following prerequisites must be supplied:
	1)  To use the default Derby Embedded DB, you need to copy
	    derby.jar (10.2.2.0 or 10.4.2.0) to the lib directory.
	2)  To use the default Apache OpenJPA provider, you need to copy
	    openjpa.jar and its dependencies (or just openjpa-all.jar)
	    to the lib directory.

Deployment plans for use with Apache Geronimo 2.1/2.2 are located in the plans
subdirectory.
